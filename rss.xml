Vim has a lot of built-in settings and features for handling whitespace, and this article will go over those with the examples the Vim help pages lack. For the purposes of this article, tabs are represented as blocks of the character: &#x2591;. Settings This section pertains to Vim&#x27;s built-in settings flags.

It&#x27;s simple, works on both Vim and Neovim, and can perform operations asynchronously. vim-plug Syntax Vim comes with a JavaScript syntax file. It is automatically loaded when you open up a JavaScript file (where the value of filetype is javascript). By default Vim doesn&#x27;t automatically detect filetypes, so if you aren&#x27;t using vim-plug (for which the call to call plug#end() enables this), you&#x27;ll need to enable it manually by&#x2026;]]></description><link>https://davidosomething.com/blog/vim-for-javascript</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://davidosomething.com/blog/vim-for-javascript</guid></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rebuilding davidosomething.com as a static site]]></title><description><![CDATA[I&#x27;ve rebuilt my website from the ground-up for the new year, finishing it just in time.

This makes it difficult to keep track of your own branches when you have a lot of them checked out locally. To remedy this, I wrote a shell script that gets all the remote git branches and filters them out based on the last committer. It then lists the ones where you were the last committer.

The RC for Linux Mint 17 is out so maybe that will fix some things, but the main problem I&rsquo;ve had is with installing packages. Apt just doesn&rsquo;t cut it, especially when I think back to when I was using ArchLinux. So I&rsquo;m going back to Arch and the next post will be about that.

It&rsquo;s a bare drive, which means it doesn&rsquo;t come with a SATA cable or box. Now I&rsquo;ve got a total of 2 TB of storage with 1 TB already full. I used my super-difficult-to-open Lacie case (pried it open with scissors) to house and connect the bare drive while I formatted it.

I am completely out of the consumer PC hardware loop and ended up getting the i7-860 (1156) instead of an i5.
