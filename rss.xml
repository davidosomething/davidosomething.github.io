This makes it difficult to keep track of your own branches when you have a lot of them checked out locally. To remedy this, I wrote a shell script that gets all the remote git branches and filters them out based on the last committer. It then lists the ones where you were the last committer. You can find the script here:https://github.com/davidosomething/git-my Here’s a screenshot of it in action: ]]></description><link>http://davidosomething.com/blog/git-my</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://davidosomething.com/blog/git-my</guid></item><item><title><![CDATA[Linux on the Lenovo Thinkpad W510 – Part 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[The NVidia drivers after 343.22 no longer support the NVidia Quadro FX 880M GPU for the ThinkPad W510 so I had to switch to legacy drivers (340-xx).

The RC for Linux Mint 17 is out so maybe that will fix some things, but the main problem I’ve had is with installing packages. Apt just doesn’t cut it, especially when I think back to when I was using ArchLinux. So I’m going back to Arch and the next post will be about that. Apt’s greatest downfall is that as you add PPAs and when you start needing multiple architectures, the dependency chain breaks and is almost impossible to fix.

It’s not all bad. I had been using an old (2004) DELL machine at work with Windows XP. Needless to say, the machine was pagefaulting and had a bunch of problems with its RAM. So they finally got me a new computer to work on — a 24″ iMac with an i3 processor. Not exactly a beast, but it’s a big upgrade. I was using Notepad++ on my PC and I am ridiculously fast on it.

It’s a bare drive, which means it doesn’t come with a SATA cable or box. Now I’ve got a total of 2 TB of storage with 1 TB already full. I used my super-difficult-to-open Lacie case (pried it open with scissors) to house and connect the bare drive while I formatted it.

A few of the benefits include: Using SSH to connect to a Linux commandline is faster compared to RDP’ing or VNC’ing into a Windows machine (also saves battery life on smartphones).

It totally looks like a toaster, but it’s cool. It’s going to be an always-on HTPC for the living room. I am completely out of the consumer PC hardware loop and ended up getting the i7-860 (1156) instead of an i5. The major, major difference for these two would be the availability of integrated graphics on the i5, vs two extra cores on the i7.

The key point is that fonts, and not typefaces, are defined. A font is “any variant in a typeface’s size and style” (Jon Tan). A key element missing from many @font-face resources online (e.g., tutorials, and CSS generators like Font Squirrel) is the definition of weight and style in the @font-face rule. These two properties are vital when you want to properly use a typeface.
